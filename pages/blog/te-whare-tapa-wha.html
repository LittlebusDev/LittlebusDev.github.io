          <h3>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h3>
          <p>
            This is something I've been trying to get back into the habit of
            doing, but I would like to go back to a yoga practise. I loved going
            and feeling like being there was a real treat for me, like I was
            really loving myself and treating myself well. While studying and
            working meant that I didn't always prioritise it and it fell out of
            my routine when deadlines loomed, which made me sad and then I
            started to lose motivation to go. But I understand that while I
            might be able to put some other things on the back-burner yoga
            really shouldn't be one of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would really love to commit to one session of yoga a week. It
            doesn't have to be a full 2 hour session like I used to engage in,
            and it doesn't always have to be hot power yoga, I think I should be
            bringing in more Yin yoga into my life
          </p>
          <p>
            Another physical activty that really brings me peace is running.
            Once I get past the warm-up part of the run, I start to slip into
            the rhythm, the pace and the whole world tends to dissappear. I have
            managed to keep onto one long running session a week, so I would
            like to continue to keep up with this! I think it's really
            important.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would love to bring in more weight training sessions into my
            physical wellbeing. I derive a lot of my self confidence from
            feeling capable, both mentally and physically, so I really get that
            boost after a great weights session. I have been going 1-2 times a
            week at my peak, so I would like to continue this practise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I walk my dog on the beach for an hour every day. This is
            such a lovely part of my evening, I get to connect with my partner
            who I may or may not have seen much that day, and get to see my dog
            all happy in his favourite place. In Summer, it's particularly
            beautiful as I get to put my feet in the ocean and walk in the
            waves, and that's a particular sort of pleasure I've never had
            before, having never lived by the ocean before.
          </p>

          <h3>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</h3>
          <p>
            The last point of my previous section does flow on quite nicely to
            this section. My partner is my family and being able to carve out an
            hour of time to be with each other even though we both work from
            home is really important. It's dedicated time with each other and
            our dog.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also make quite a lot of time for my family and my partners family
            as I've always had such a strong connection with my family. I try
            and make sure that we see some of our family once a week or at the
            very least once a fortnight. This is something I would like to keep
            commiting to as I really value the relationships I've cultivated
            with both our families, it's very precious to me.
          </p>
          <h3>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h3>
          <p>
            This is something that is new to me, I don't think I've been very
            good at taking care of my mental wellbeing very well at all. I have
            recently started introducing more hobbies into my life to put my
            selfworth into something other than what dress size I am. It's taken
            a lot of work, but I've become really proud of the strides I've been
            making.
          </p>
          <p>
            To build on this, I would like to continue making time for my
            hobbies as I find the repetative actions in knitting and crochet to
            be really meditative and the sense of pride and fulfilment I get
            from finishing a project and thinking "man, I made that!" is
            amazing!
          </p>
          <p>
            While the hobbies are great, I would also like to start journalling.
            I think this would be a great way to start taking stock of the day,
            remembering the good parts and the bad parts and challenging myself
            to take something positive away from even the most negative of days.
            I really think this will help decompress from the day, and stop my
            brain from running a million miles a minute when I get my head down
            on the pillow each night!
          </p>
          <p>
            I think starting small in this is the best way to go (as per the
            advice in Atomic Habits by James Clear - great read!) and I know I
            struggle to form good habits, so I think if I can commit initially
            to a once a week decompress journal entry as a hard rule, and then
            if I want to add more during the week that's okay too - this will
            help make it a long lasting habit that I can hopefully keep for a
            while!
          </p>
          <h3>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h3>
          <p>
            Again I think the last point of my previous section flows on really
            nicely onto this section, as I feel like making the time to journal
            will help me to express my gratitude each day.
          </p>
          <h3>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h3>
          <p>
            I love to garden, and I love growing things in my garden that I then
            use to feed or heal people that I love! I grow both fruit and
            vegetables as well as some herbs that I use for teas or balms etc to
            help with minor ailments, and I derive great joy from being able to
            do that. I don't feel I need to commit to more time to this, as I
            feel doing these actions are so deeply routed into my personal
            happiness and how I express love for my friends and family, that I
            couldn't stop even if I wanted to! :D
