        <p>
          As designers and humans we love white space. <br>Great swathes of it as far as the eye can see!
          <br>Well maybe not <em>THAT</em> far but, quite far. It not only gives us some breathing room
          between elements, but it helps give the ole eyeballs somewhere to rest. It's calming.
          Take these two images for example - which do you think looks most "restful"? 
        </p>
        <div class="images">
           <img id="left-image" src="/images/cluttered-desk.webp" alt="picture of very cluttered desk">
           <img id="right-image" src="/images/clean-desk.jpeg" alt="picture of very clean desk">
        </div>
        <p>
          Now unless you're a statistical anomoly (in which case.. erm. sorry?) you're going to prefer
          the image on the right. The space between the things make it look more calm and clear.
          It has the added bonus of being able to showcase the indiviudal items more.
          <br>
          Now try this for me, take a look at the picture on the left, and then close your eyes.
          Can you tell me how many pens and penils there are in the image?
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          No?
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Of course you can't.
          <br>
          Now, look at the picture on the right and then close your eyes. Can you remember how many pens there are?
          One. You're right! See how much easier it was to identify the individual items? That's because of the white space
          between the items and the white space around the image as a whole
        </p>
        <p>So, now I've (hopefully) demonstrated how important white space is for design in general, how does this relate to coding?
          And what on earth does it have to do with margins, borders and padding (oh  my!) - sorry, can't resist..
          <br>
          Well these three CSS styling tools are going to be invaluable in helping us create that big ole sea of white space
          that we all crave. Let's start at the outside and work our way down - like an onion.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="main-section-right">
        <h1>
          Margin, Borders & Padding - Oh My!
        </h1>
        <h2>
          What are they and why do we use each one? <br>
          <em
            >Let's get technical bay-bee</em
          >
        </h2>

    <div class="overflow-text-section">
      <h2>The Outer Layers</h2>
      <p>So if I use the homepage of my website as an example, we can see that the image should go right to the edge of the screen like this
        because I have my margin set to 0px.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/imac-website.png" alt="imac screen with image of honepage">
      <p>Now if I wanted to add a margin, it would end up looking something more like this;</p>
      <img src="/images/imac-website-margin.png" alt="imac screen with image of homepage with margin added">
      <p>Do you see the space we've added all around the website? That's the margin - the space around the outside of your content. <br>
        This works will all element blocks, like divs, images, paragraphs etc, you can add a margin (the space around the outside) to all of them.
        <br>
        We add the margin by using the css syntax of [ margin: --px ] (or whatever measurement you're using.)  
        There are of course many ways to edit the margin, <br> but I'll save that for another blog post - for now, this will do.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> Down a layer we go.
      </p>
      <h2>The Border Layer</h2>
      <p>Now we come to the border.<br>
      While technically this is a way of adding "space" to an element, it's often used more like a decorative addition.
      It does exactly what it says on the tin <br> - adds a border. If we go back to our website example, right now we've added the margin
      (the space around the outside of the element - good well remembered!) so now let's add a border.
      <br>
      I'm going to add a lovely solid pink chunky border to the whole of the website. What do you think?
      </p>
      <img src="/images/imac-website-margin-border.png" alt="imac screen with image of homepage with margin and border added">
      <p>Now aethetically, this is kinda trash. But you get the idea of how the border works? <br> Again, there are many ways to
        add a border and mess around with how it looks, <br> but the syntax is probably how you'd expect it to be [ border: --px ]
        with a [ border-style: solid ] and [ border-color: #FAB8E5 ]
      </p>
      <h2>The Padding Layer [the final boss]</h2>
      <p>Okay, so we have padding around the <strong>outside</strong> of our website called the....? Margin! Yes!
      <br> And then we have this aesthetically pleasing what around the edge of  our website? Border! Yeah! 
      <br> Now we think okay, well I like the spacing, but I feel like all the "stuff" in my website is too close to the edge.
      How do we fix that? With padding! 
    <br> A good way to think of padding, is like wrapping your content in bubblewrap, to protect it from the "edges" 
    of your container (be that a div, or box or ehat have you)
    <br> 
    <br>Let's go bck to our website example. If we wanted to add padding, we would be 
    <br>
    adding space between the content (the words, and images etc)
    and the edge of our website, the space in between. So it would look like this;
  </p>
  <img src="/images/imac-website-margin-border-padding.png" alt="imac screen with image of homepage with margin and border and padding added">
  <p>And again, there are some fun ways we could change this up to make the padding look different, but the styntax fot this would be [ padding: --px ] 
    <br><br><br>
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion
  </h2>
  <p>There are many ways to add white space, and these are just a few of them. I hope I managed to explain them a little bit without it getting
    <br> too over-complicated or me wandering off on my own lil tangent...
