          <h3>Neuroplasticity - What is it?</h3>

          <p>
            The brain is not a fixed, rigid quantity with no ability for
            movement or growth. The Little Grey Cells (tm) are able to move and
            grow depending on what you’re learning and how often you’re
            learning. This means that we are not “stuck” with the brain capacity
            we’re born with, and we can learn and grow and adapt!
          </p>

          <h3>How can we engage principles to our benefit?</h3>

          <p>
            For me I can use these principles to learn new skills, be that
            coding or sewing or pottery which will help me create things for
            myself and people I love around me, including a new career path. All
            down to the fact that I can learn, grow my brain, and solidify these
            ideas via practice and patience.
          </p>

          <h3>What are some of thats to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
          <p>
            Practise practise practise! As well as mentally reviewing or “going
            through the motions” of the actions that you’re trying to commit to
            memory or skills you’re hoping to encourage long term.
          </p>

          <h3>Growth Mindset What is it and why is it relevant?</h3>
          <p>
            Growth mindset is the belief that you can. That your only limitation
            in learning and bettering yourself are self imposed. Especially in
            classroom settings like Dev Academy, where the subject matter can be
            quite taxing, having that growth mindset of “I can do this, I just
            need to figure out how to make it work for me”
          </p>

          <h3>
            In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Not really? I have done this study before during my diploma, and I
            have done Psychology papers, so I knew this information and the
            importance of engaging in learning materials with this particular
            mindset.
          </p>

          <h3>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h3>
          <p>
            I would like to keep incorporating adding journalling or at least
            some reflection at the end of the school day, to help cement the
            things that I have learned that day. I also know that teaching the
            information I’ve learned to someone else, really helps me keep hold
            of the knowledge I’ve gained that day, so I would also like to keep
            this as part of my learning strategy
