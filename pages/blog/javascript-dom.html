          <h3>Where to start?</h3>

          <p>
            At this point in our journey, we've gone over HTML (the main heart
            of our website) CSS (the "pretty" layer of our website) and we have
            a pretty okay (albeit static) website. Now, how do we interact with
            it? JavaScript! And an understanding of the DOM.
          </p>

          <h3>So what is JavaScript?</h3>

          <p>
            Javascript is another coding language (like HTML and CSS) and this
            is how we do things like make working buttons, make things sparkle,
            make things move, add comments, like, share, purchase etc. Think of
            it as the final layer of a website to take it from a photograph to a
            moving interactable video.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you have a handy-dandy analogy for me?</h3>

          <p>
            Yeah! I do! So a slightly easier way to think of JavaScript in
            relation to HTML and CSS would be like a lock and a key. In this
            example, lets say that the lock is the HTML and the key is the CSS.
            A lock is a useful item, it's fine just as it is. It's a lock. Cool.
            We love locks. JavaScript in this analogy would be the ACT of using
            the key to unlock and lock the lock. So without Javascript, the lock
            and key would just be a lock and key. But <em>WITH</em> JavaScript,
            it's a functioning lockable and unlockable thing.
            <br />
            <br />
            Does that make sense?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="main-section-right">
          <h1>JavaScript & the DOM</h1>
          <h2>
            What is it? How does it fit with HTML & CSS?<br />
            <em>Let's get learning bay-bee</em>
          </h2>
          <h3>1st JULY 2023</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="overflow-text-section">
        <h3>Okay, so what next?</h3>
        <p>
          So now we have an idea of what JavaScript is, how do we use? Well we
          cn't go much further until we understand how JavaScript is read by the
          browser. This is what's called the DOM.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DOM (Document Object Model), is a visual representation of the
          code written in such a way that allows JavaScript to interact with it.
          So everything that we write in our HTML and CSS document gets packaged
          up and converted into a single object - hence the name Document
          Object!
          <br />
          Are you still with me? Let's try and show it visually!
        </p>
        <p>Here is what our HTML looks like regularly</p>
        <img src="/images/code-text.png" alt="image of written code" />
        <p>
          Do you see how many individual elements there are here? How many lines
          of readable code? <br />
          A few! Now imagine trying to access all of that individually when
          you're trying to make it interact-able.. Nightmare.
          <br />
          So to make this easy on us, the browser looks at all of our code and
          packages it all toegther for us into simple, readable 'blobs' like
          this;
          <img src="/images/illustrated-div.png" alt="image of code" />
        </p>
        <p>
          With me so far?
          <br />
          Okay so what does this mean for us and JavaScript? Well quite a bit.
          JavaScript is written in a way to interact with THIS display of our
          HTML and CSS. It's written on the assumtion that the information we've
          put into our HTML and CSS will be displayed like this in the DOM, so
          this is how we need to interact without HTML.
        </p>

        <h3>So how do we interact?</h3>
        <p>
          Woah woah, hang on. Before we interact, we need to learn about how the
          information is <em>read</em> by our browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's think of our HTML being read like making a mug with clay. There
          are a few steps to get us from wet clay to solid mug, and they all
          have to be done in a particular order, otherwise it won't work.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) So we need to start with wedging the clay and getting it ready
          (otherwise our mug could crack in the kiln)
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Then we need to smack the clay around a little bit (otherwise the
          mug could warp in the kiln)
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Then we throw the clay on a wheel (otherwise our mug would just be
          a lump of clay)
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) Then we need to leave it to dry so we can trim it (otherwise our
          mug would be ugly)
        </p>
        <p>Then we trim and add a handle (otherwise our mug would be a pot)</p>
        <p>
          (5) Then we leave it to dry all the way to bone dry (otherwise our mug
          could explode in the kiln)
        </p>
        <p>
          (6) Then we bisque fire our mug (otherwise our mug won't be
          waterproof)
        </p>
        <p>
          (7) Then we glaze our mug (otherwise our mug won't be safe to drink
          out of)
        </p>
        <p>
          (8) Then we glaze fire our mug (otherwise the glaze would just be a
          toxic powdery mess)
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>AND NOW WE HAVE A MUG!</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          So these steps need to be carried out in a specific order, to get us
          to our mug. There's a very specific order, otherwise it won't work.
          This is known as "CONTROL FLOW" and that is what our JavaScript is
          creating for the DOM. The JavaScript is the way we tell the DOM what
          order to read our code.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we've given our DOM a way to read our HTML & CSS (mug making
          instructions) and the DOM will read it from top to bottom and only
          progress if the statment has been completed (e.g the clay has been
          wedged, so now we go to smacking it a bit, once that's done we're move
          onto throwing and so on)
        </p>
        <p>
          But what if we wanted to change our order? What if we wanted to
          underglaze so we glaze fire and bisque fire at the same time? Or what
          if we wanted to add another step? We can do that with something called
          "CONDITIONALS" and "LOOPS"
        </p>

        <h3>What's a conditional?</h3>
        <p>
          In coding, they're if..else statements. "If this happens, do this, or
          if it doesn't happen, do that." If we bring back our mug making
          example, it would be "if you want to underglaze, make this your
          working order - <br />
          <br />(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (7), (6). <br /><br />
          Otherwise make your working order<br />
          <br />(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Still with me?</p>

        <h3>Okay, so what's a loop?</h3>
        <p>
          Looping is asking the code to repeat steps, over and over again until
          your conditions have been met (or not if you forget to put one)
        </p>
        <p>
          So in our example, let's say we have a relatively large kiln, and we
          don't want to waste time and money by only firing one item at a time.
          We would make a few more mugs, to fill the kiln and fire them all
          toegther right? So we would "LOOP" our process -
          <br />
          start at (1), and progress all the way to (5), [that's one loop]
          <br />
          until we have enough mugs to fill the kiln, then stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          That my friend is a "LOOP". Keep doing this one thing, until this
          thing happens. You need to have an end point for your "LOOP" otherwise
          this would keep happening over and over and over and over again until
          you run out of studio space, or your machine crashes.
        </p>

        <h3>Let's talk arrays and objects!</h3>
        <p>
          Information can be accessed a couple of ways in Javascript, two of
          which are "ARRAYS" and "OBJECTS".
          <br />
          <br />
          Arrays can look like this;
        </p>
        <img
          src="/images/pottery-array.png"
          alt="screenshot of code displaying an array"
        />
        <p>
          We can see there are 4 elements (types of pottery items) in the array;
          mug, cup, pot, vase and they would be numbered like this;
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="/images/pottery-array-numbered.png"
          alt="screenshot of code displaying a numbered array"
        />
        <p>
          When coding, you always start counting from 0, so the first element in
          our array will be stored as item [0]. This is really important to
          remember when trying to access the information stored within the
          array. Okay cool we've got some information stored in an array, and we
          know what position that information sits in within the array, but what
          do we do with it? How can we access items?
        </p>
        <p>You can access it like this;</p>
        <img
          src="/images/potter-current-project.png"
          alt="screenshot of code showing printing myCurrentProject"
        />
        <p>
          So that's one way of storing data and accessing the data. How about
          "OBJECTS"? They look a little different to "ARRAYS" and you access the
          information a little differently. We'll keep to the pottery analogies
          to keep everything cohesive! Below is an example of an object;
        </p>
        <img
          src="/images/pottery-mug-object.png"
          alt="screenshot of code showing mug object"
        />
        <p>
          See how there's only one item (the mug), which is the object, but
          within that object there are different bits of information? These bits
          of information are called Object Properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can access each bit of information in two different ways, one
          called the dot method, and one called the square bracket method, both
          do the trick and it comes down to personal preference.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/images/pottery-mug-object-property.png"
          alt="screenshot of code showing the way to access properties in an object"
        />
        <h3>So what are "FUNCTIONS"?</h3>
        <p>
          Functions (as the name suggests) is a block of code that completes a
          function, or particular task. The easiest way to demonstrate a
          function is by doing simple multiplications, like this;
        </p>
        <img
          src="/images/function-example.png"
          alt="screenshot of code showing a function"
        />
        <p>Here I've labelled each section of the function to make it easier</p>
        <img
          src="/images/function-example-labelled.png"
          alt="code to show labelled fucntion"
        />
        <p>
          Here you can see that we've called our fucntion myFirstFunction and
          we've given it two things (parameters) to do the task with, and then
          inside the curly brackets we've specified what we want this function
          to do. In this case it's add together the value of NumberA and NumberB
        </p>
        <p>
          In order for the function to work however, we need to "CALL" it, and
          give it some real numbers. Which would look like this;
        </p>
        <img
          src="/images/function-calling.png"
          alt="code to show called function"
        />
        <p>
          So there are two parts to a function - <br />
          (1) DECLARING or creating the function & <br />
          (2) CALLING the function - making it do what we've asked it to
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is this useful? Well as you get to writing lots of code, there
          will be a time when you have to do the same action more than once, so
          instead of writing it out over and over again, you can just call the
          same function! You can re-use it as many times as you need
        </p>

      <div class="break">
        <img src="/images/flower-beige.png" alt="vector of beige flower" />
        <img src="/images/flower-beige.png" alt="vector of beige flower" />
