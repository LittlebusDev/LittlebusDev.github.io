          <h3>Where to start?</h3>

          <p>
            At this point in our journey, we've gone over HTML (the main heart
            of our website) CSS (the "pretty" layer of our website) and we have
            a pretty okay (albeit static) website. Now, how do we interact with
            it? JavaScript! And an understanding of the DOM.
          </p>

          <h3>So what is JavaScript?</h3>

          <p>
            Javascript is another coding language (like HTML and CSS) and this
            is how we do things like make working buttons, make things sparkle,
            make things move, add comments, like, share, purchase etc. Think of
            it as the final layer of a website to take it from a photograph to a
            moving interactable video.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you have a handy-dandy analogy for me?</h3>

          <p>
            Yeah! I do! So a slightly easier way to think of JavaScript in
            relation to HTML and CSS would be like a lock and a key. In this
            example, lets say that the lock is the HTML and the key is the CSS.
            A lock is a useful item, it's fine just as it is. It's a lock. Cool.
            We love locks. JavaScript in this analogy would be the ACT of using
            the key to unlock and lock the lock. So without Javascript, the lock
            and key would just be a lock and key. But <em>WITH</em> JavaScript,
            it's a functioning lockable and unlockable thing.
            <br />
            <br />
            Does that make sense?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="main-section-right">
          <h1>JavaScript & the DOM</h1>
          <h2>
            What is it? How does it fit with HTML & CSS?<br />
            <em>Let's get learning bay-bee</em>
          </h2>
          <h3>1st JULY 2023</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="overflow-text-section">
        <h3>Okay, so what next?</h3>
        <p>
          So now we have an idea of what JavaScript is, how do we use? Well we
          cn't go much further until we understand how JavaScript is read by the
          browser. This is what's called the DOM.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DOM (Document Object Model), is a visual representation of the
          code written in such a way that allows JavaScript to interact with it.
          So everything that we write in our HTML and CSS document gets packaged
          up and converted into a single object - hence the name Document
          Object!
          <br />
          Are you still with me? Let's try and show it visually!
        </p>
        <p>Here is what our HTML looks like regularly</p>
        <img src="/images/code-text.png" alt="image of written code" />
        <p>
          Do you see how many individual elements there are here? How many lines
          of readable code? <br />
          A few! Now imagine trying to access all of that individually when
          you're trying to make it interact-able.. Nightmare.
          <br />
          So to make this easy on us, the browser looks at all of our code and
          packages it all toegther for us into simple, readable 'blobs' like
          this;
          <img src="/images/illustrated-div.png" alt="image of code" />
        </p>
        <p>
          With me so far?
          <br />
          Okay so what does this mean for us and JavaScript? Well quite a bit.
          JavaScript is written in a way to interact with THIS display of our
          HTML and CSS. It's written on the assumtion that the information we've
          put into our HTML and CSS will be displayed like this in the DOM, so
          this is how we need to interact without HTML.
        </p>

        <h3>So how do we interact?</h3>
        <p>
          Woah woah, hang on. Before we interact, we need to learn about how the
          information is <em>read</em> by our browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's think of our HTML being read like making a mug with clay. There
          are a few steps to get us from wet clay to solid mug, and they all
          have to be done in a particular order, otherwise it won't work.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) So we need to start with wedging the clay and getting it ready
          (otherwise our mug could crack in the kiln)
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Then we need to smack the clay around a little bit (otherwise the
          mug could warp in the kiln)
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Then we throw the clay on a wheel (otherwise our mug would just be
          a lump of clay)
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) Then we need to leave it to dry so we can trim it (otherwise our
          mug would be ugly)
        </p>
        <p>Then we trim and add a handle (otherwise our mug would be a pot)</p>
        <p>
          (5) Then we leave it to dry all the way to bone dry (otherwise our mug
          could explode in the kiln)
        </p>
        <p>
          (6) Then we bisque fire our mug (otherwise our mug won't be
          waterproof)
        </p>
        <p>
          (7) Then we glaze our mug (otherwise our mug won't be safe to drink
          out of)
        </p>
        <p>
          (8) Then we glaze fire our mug (otherwise the glaze would just be a
          toxic powdery mess)
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>AND NOW WE HAVE A MUG!</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          So these steps need to be carried out in a specific order, to get us
          to our mug. There's a very specific order, otherwise it won't work.
          This is known as "CONTROL FLOW" and that is what our JavaScript is
          creating for the DOM. The JavaScript is the way we tell the DOM what
          order to read our code.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we've given our DOM a way to read our HTML & CSS (mug making
          instructions) and the DOM will read it from top to bottom and only
          progress if the statment has been completed (e.g the clay has been
          wedged, so now we go to smacking it a bit, once that's done we're move
          onto throwing and so on)
        </p>
        <p>
          But what if we wanted to change our order? What if we wanted to
          underglaze so we glaze fire and bisque fire at the same time? Or what
          if we wanted to add another step? We can do that with something called
          "CONDITIONALS" and "LOOPS"
        </p>

        <h3>What's a conditional?</h3>
        <p>
          In coding, they're if..else statements. "If this happens, do this, or
          if it doesn't happen, do that." If we bring back our mug making
          example, it would be "if you want to underglaze, make this your
          working order - <br />
          <br />(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (7), (6). <br /><br />
          Otherwise make your working order<br />
          <br />(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Still with me?</p>

        <h3>Okay, so what's a loop?</h3>
        <p>
          Looping is asking the code to repeat steps, over and over again until
          your conditions have been met (or not if you forget to put one)
        </p>
        <p>
          So in our example, let's say we have a relatively large kiln, and we
          don't want to waste time and money by only firing one item at a time.
          We would make a few more mugs, to fill the kiln and fire them all
          toegther right? So we would "LOOP" our process - start at (1), and
          progress all the way to (5), until we have enough mugs to fill the
          kiln.
        </p>
        <p>
          That my friend is a "LOOP". Keep doing this one thing, until this
          thing happens. You need to have an end point for your "LOOP" otherwise
          this would keep happening over and over and over and over again until
          you run out of studio space, or your machine crashes.
        </p>

          Okay, so we've got the DOM, we know how it should be read.. Now can we
          interact with it?
