        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

       <p>For me, a long term career pathway is headed towards an independent contractor role. I did think with my background in graphic design I would want to head into more of the UX/UI space, but I’ve really loved coding! So thinking about it this morning, I was hoping I could gear myself to the “whole” package boutique designer route, in that I could potentially take you from no brand identity or online presence, to setting you up with a logo, branding, colours, and a fully customised website. So I’d get to do all the things I’ve been really enjoying!</p>
        
        
        <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
        
        <p>For me I would say that a strength I have is that I love learning and researching and “knock-on” effect learning which can lead me to learn some weird and wonderful things and down some great rabbit holes!</p>
        
        <p>With that, comes the weakness that I often don’t know when to stop. I have really enjoyed the timer method that has been implemented here, as I really suck at setting time limitations on the fun research stage of any project.</p>
        <p>I also tend to be a bit of a perfectionist, and the idea that something is just “good enough” rather than “perfectly as I wanted it” is something I’m trying really hard to work on!</p>
        
        <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        
        <p>Personal time management and accountability for when I run over. Like I said before with my research, even if I set myself a 1 hour target for example to do some research on a topic, I would run over and then not sit down and figure out how that’s affected my timeline for the task ahead of me. 
        I have seen people use waterfall charts and Gant charts, and they are always super aspirational to me! I think I’m better at following a pre-existing one rather than trying to create my own. Which again, is why I think the time box and timer method here is really helping me!</p>
        
        <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
            * An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
            * What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
        
        <p>How I will manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners/facilitators/community representatives would be the way I’ve been working and learning with other people my whole life; with compassion and understanding that everyone is fighting their own fight and learning at their own pace - including myself!</p>
        <p>What I will do when things are building up and starting to get to me would be to take a break. It's something I've been working on a lot lately, which is to pick up on my own warning signs that I may be stuggling. Here I will try and take a break, go for a coffee, get some food and a walk and see if that helps. I have also got a whole heap of hobbies that I can indulge in that help to destress! Finally, I know that my peers and the facilitators would be a wonderful resource should I need some external help in de-stressing</p>
        
        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        
        <p>Having peers to go to for help is a big part of why I wanted to do a course in a school like setting rather than a singular online course. That would be where I would turn to first for help immediately on the Discord chat. I love how active the facilitators are on the discord page which is really encouraging and makes me feel that if I needed help I wouldn’t be interrupting their day etc so I wouldn’t be as scared to ask! I also have my dad for help who has done this course before and is working in the technical industry.</p>
        
        <h3>Description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        
        <p>I do tend to ask a lot of questions and will sometimes need a little reassurance that it’s okay to ask the questions and that I’m not ruining peoples day by asking for some of their time. Eventually I will get over the initial reticence and it will become second nature (as it has done in previous courses) but initially some reassurance that I’m not annoying would be amazing haha</p>
        
        <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
        
        <p>Nope! I have a really great support network that all understand the time commitment this course takes, and they have been wonderfully understanding of letting my home duties be a little lighter for the next few weeks!</p>
