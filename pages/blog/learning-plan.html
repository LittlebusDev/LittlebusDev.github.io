          <h2>BOOTCAMP LEARNING PLAN</h2>
          <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            I don't think my goal has changed too much since writing this plan
            initially. I'm still really keen to move towards more of the
            boutique, one stop graphic design and wesbite creation shop for
            businesses. I already have a qualifaction and career history in
            graphic design and I've started my web development skilltree, but
            I'm really hoping I'll learn enough to strike out on my own and the
            confidence that will come with having play around with a whole bunch
            of JavaScript!
          </p>
          <h3>
            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
            bootcamp?
          </h3>
          <p>
            My limitation will be not deep diving into the why and hows of why
            something works. I have some time at home to be able to go on
            youtube tangents and explore the minutia of why something works or
            different ways of doing things, and I don't think I will have the
            time to do this while I'm under the pump at Bootcamp. This is where
            my "working is good enough" mentality will have to develop!
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of strengths, I'm really looking forward to being able to
            give this everything I've got. I've confirmed to myself during
            foundations that I'm really driven to make the most out of this
            opportunity, so I'm really excited to get stuck in and revel in the
            challange of having this and only this to spend my days doing.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What do you think you biggest non-technical challnge at Bootcamp
            will be>
          </h3>
          <p>
            I touched on this a little bit in homegroup about what I think some
            aspect that will be a litle challanging is that I have managed to
            structure my day so that I can take lots of small breaks to be able
            to let information "settle in" and to give my eyes some break from
            screens and to go and "touch grass", but I'm worried that this will
            not be something I can do while I'm in bootcamp, but I won't know
            until I'm in the flow of it.
          </p>
          <h3>What are your expectations fro the Bootcamp team?</h3>
          <p>
            To me, I'm still hoping that I will be able to ask the questions I
            have and not feel like I'm taking up peoples time with too many
            questions. I like to make sure I've understood something, or have
            someone clarify or correct my thought processes, but I don't want to
            be a bother, so having someone to be able to answer my questions
            (like I've been told there's a "teachers table" where facilitators
            go when they're available to take questions) will be so helpful to
            me, because the stess of wondering if I'm going to be interrupting
            someones day will be eliminated if they're there and ready for
            questions.
          </p>

          <h3>How I'm planning to manage workload in the programme</h3>
          <p>
            I have noticed that small breaks are working for me, usually with
            learning I will sit at the computer or stare at the book until it
            makes sense, which oftentimes it wouldn't. So my plan us to make
            sure I go outside and walk, or go do some knitting, or go make a cup
            of tea to get myself away from the situation so that I don't get too
            worked up that something isn't working.
          </p>

          <h2>FOUNDATIONS LEARNING PLAN</h2>
          <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

          <p>
            For me, a long term career pathway is headed towards an independent
            contractor role. I did think with my background in graphic design I
            would want to head into more of the UX/UI space, but I’ve really
            loved coding! So thinking about it this morning, I was hoping I
            could gear myself to the “whole” package boutique designer route, in
            that I could potentially take you from no brand identity or online
            presence, to setting you up with a logo, branding, colours, and a
            fully customised website. So I’d get to do all the things I’ve been
            really enjoying!
          </p>

          <h3>
            A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning
          </h3>

          <p>
            For me I would say that a strength I have is that I love learning
            and researching and “knock-on” effect learning which can lead me to
            learn some weird and wonderful things and down some great rabbit
            holes!
          </p>

          <p>
            With that, comes the weakness that I often don’t know when to stop.
            I have really enjoyed the timer method that has been implemented
            here, as I really suck at setting time limitations on the fun
            research stage of any project.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also tend to be a bit of a perfectionist, and the idea that
            something is just “good enough” rather than “perfectly as I wanted
            it” is something I’m trying really hard to work on!
          </p>

          <h3>
            What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </h3>

          <p>
            Personal time management and accountability for when I run over.
            Like I said before with my research, even if I set myself a 1 hour
            target for example to do some research on a topic, I would run over
            and then not sit down and figure out how that’s affected my timeline
            for the task ahead of me. I have seen people use waterfall charts
            and Gant charts, and they are always super aspirational to me! I
            think I’m better at following a pre-existing one rather than trying
            to create my own. Which again, is why I think the time box and timer
            method here is really helping me!
          </p>

          <h3>
            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
            This should include: * An explanation of how you will manage
            yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,
            Facilitators and industry/community representatives * What you will
            do when things are building up and starting to get to you
          </h3>

          <p>
            How I will manage myself to work productively and safely with other
            learners/facilitators/community representatives would be the way
            I’ve been working and learning with other people my whole life; with
            compassion and understanding that everyone is fighting their own
            fight and learning at their own pace - including myself!
          </p>
          <p>
            What I will do when things are building up and starting to get to me
            would be to take a break. It's something I've been working on a lot
            lately, which is to pick up on my own warning signs that I may be
            stuggling. Here I will try and take a break, go for a coffee, get
            some food and a walk and see if that helps. I have also got a whole
            heap of hobbies that I can indulge in that help to destress!
            Finally, I know that my peers and the facilitators would be a
            wonderful resource should I need some external help in de-stressing
          </p>

          <h3>
            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
          </h3>

          <p>
            Having peers to go to for help is a big part of why I wanted to do a
            course in a school like setting rather than a singular online
            course. That would be where I would turn to first for help
            immediately on the Discord chat. I love how active the facilitators
            are on the discord page which is really encouraging and makes me
            feel that if I needed help I wouldn’t be interrupting their day etc
            so I wouldn’t be as scared to ask! I also have my dad for help who
            has done this course before and is working in the technical
            industry.
          </p>

          <h3>Description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>

          <p>
            I do tend to ask a lot of questions and will sometimes need a little
            reassurance that it’s okay to ask the questions and that I’m not
            ruining peoples day by asking for some of their time. Eventually I
            will get over the initial reticence and it will become second nature
            (as it has done in previous courses) but initially some reassurance
            that I’m not annoying would be amazing haha
          </p>

          <h3>
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
            committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
            commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
          </h3>

          <p>
            Nope! I have a really great support network that all understand the
            time commitment this course takes, and they have been wonderfully
            understanding of letting my home duties be a little lighter for the
            next few weeks!
