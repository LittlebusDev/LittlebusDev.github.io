            What are three new things I have learnt about myself and my ego due
            to core learning?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I have really cemented a few ideas about my ego and how I believe a
            lot of my self worth is tied up in how capable I feel when faced
            with a task. So when I was faced with a couple of tasks that I
            thought were above my current skill level, I was really worried that
            I was a lot dumber than my peers or even than I believed I was. This
            is something I have struggled with for a while, but what I've
            managed to learn from foundations is that I don't have to tackle the
            whole task in one go. Having been given the tools to help me break
            down a problem, I have been able to help myself filter through my
            emotions in terms of "okay what do I actually think is happening
            here, do I actually feel like I know none of this or is my ego a
            little bruised because I don't know as much as I think I should know
            by this part of the course"
            <br />
            I honestly think this is a skill that I will be able to take with me
            into bootcamp, but also hopefully into my wider life.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the looping and listening phases, I have been able to realise
            that I haven't been talking about myself in the nicest way during
            this process. Even when explaining how I'm feeling to others during
            those exercises, hearing those words repeated to me, it doesn't come
            off as it sounds in my head and I think this is something I could be
            working on too. I'm in this to learn and I shouldn't me getting mad
            at myself or badmouthing myself. I wouldn't talk about a friend that
            unkindly, so why should I talk about myself that way?
          </p>
          <p>
            Another thing I have noticed during the core sessions is that I take
            a lot of pride in how I am able to help others, and during this
            process of learning, I'm probably not going to be able to help as
            much as I would like to. So this will have to take some getting used
            to. I love being able to provide and assist in any way I can, and
            I'm trying to get used to the feeling that I'm the one that's
            needing the help. I don't know how to get used to this and I know
            that this will have to be something I work on, as I want to get the
            most out of this course and use all the tools at my disposal, and
            maybe other people like to help as much as I do, so I should let
            them...
          </p>
          <h3>
            What are the roles of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning
            and programming?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I think all of these play a vital role in programming and learning.
            If you don't know your values, how will you know how you can fit
            into a learning environment? How will you know how to work with
            others? How do you know yourself if you don't know your values?
            Empathy especially in a learning environment is crucial! Everyone
            learns at their own pace, everyone has different experiences that
            make up who they are and how they should be interacted with. Being
            empathetic to people will help create a safe learning environment
            that will ultimately benefit everyone and enable us all to learn
            most effectively.
            <br />This is inherantly linked to self-awareness. Being aware of
            yourself and what your stressors are or what your tolerance is for
            things will also help to cultivate a safe learning environment for
            yourself. It will provide you with the space you need and the tools
            you require to be able to learn in the most effective way.
          </p>
          <h3>Wha has surprised me the most about the core learning</h3>
          <p>
            The core learning has really helped me to create a space for myself
            to have a little but more of a conversation with myself and get a
            deeper understanding of what I need and how I will best thrive in a
            learning environment, but also to help me extrapolate these thoughts
            into a work/life environment too. Because of the core learning and
            the tasks set for me, I have started journalling at night (or the
            next morning if I couldn't do it the night before) which I'm really
            enjoying. This is something I've said I would do for ages, but
            because it's not an "enforced" thing, I've never followed through.
            Not that I think it's enforced here, but being able to frame it in a
            way like "oh it's for school" has made me take the want a little
            more seriously, and I have started a cute bullet journal. And It's
            been really theraputic to be able to sit and take something good
            away from the day, especially if it's been a tough learning day.
          </p>
          <h3>What were the most challanging aspects of the core learning</h3>
          <p>
            I can get very impatient, and I've been so excited about aquiring
            this new skill that sometimes I wish I could skip past the core
            sessions and get into some more coding! But when I do sit and do sit
            and do them, I'm always so glad I did, because I always learn a
            little somethinf about myself that I may not have otherwise taken
            the time to get to understand.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Why do I think Dev Academy, a programming school, are spending so
            mucg time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp
            course
          </h3>
          <p>
            Because they're teaching us how to learn. They're giving us all the
            skills and self-reflection skills to be able to look at a problem
            and see how it fits into OUR way of thinking. It's like teaching us
            a new superpower. Once you understand what your limitations are, or
            how you as a person process a problem, or celebrate a victory, how
            you cope with stress, or what makes you feel capable, you're able to
            start building your learning plans and education wants and goals
            with these in mind. It's really cool honestly.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Does the time I spent studying core learning feel like a waste of
            time? Should I have just used the time to practise programming
            instead? Justify your answer.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Absolutely not. No way. I have got a much clearer understanding of
            myself and how I approach problems, as well as giving me the
            mechanisms I need to solve the problems. I feel like I am WAY more
            equipped mentally to deal with the potential stressors I will face
            in Bootcamp than I was before. I also think that this helps everyone
            headed into Bootcamp because we'll all be equipped with this
            knowledge, which will make it so much easier to help people. If we
            can all accurately describe how best we need help, we're more likely
            to be able to get the specific help that's going to help us get the
            most out of the course and our learning ability. It also means
            inversely, if we're stressed, or reaching our limit, we're able to
            articulate exactly where the limit is, which means other people can
            take that into consideration when working with us or around us.
