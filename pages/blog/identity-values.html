        <h2>The Write-Up From Sprint 1</h2>
        <br />
        <br />

        <h3>When have I had to make an ethical decision?</h3>
        <p>
          I feel like as a collective of people we make ethical decisions every
          day? <br />Every time we choose to buy local - that's an ethical
          decision. <br />Every time we choose to recycle - that's an ethical
          decision. <br />Growing my own food - ethical decision..
          <br />
          I make these choices everyday
        </p>

        <h3>
          How your culture and the people around you have influenced your values
          and identity.
        </h3>

        <p>
          I have such a supportive network around me who are helping me to
          realise that what I think and feel should matter to me as much as I
          think other peoples thoughts and feelings should matter. They’re
          helping me put my foot down more and stand up for what I think
          matters, and not back down when I can see that what I think may not
          align with what other people think.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h3>

        <p>
          think my ability to get along with most people will really help when
          working in group environments! I like to think that I can help create
          a supportive atmosphere and help people whenever they need it.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h3>

        <p>
          My limitations will be that I will often think one thing, but not
          often raise it if I feel it’s not worth the upset it could cause, so I
          tend to let things happen that I don’t particularly want to happen,
          just because I don’t want to upset anyone. In the past when I’ve stood
          up for myself and put my foot down for what I think should happen or
          what I think should be the way forward, I have been called “combative”
          because I’m usually so placid. This feeds into my fear of standing up
          whenever I disagree because I don’t want people to think badly of me
          or not want to work with me in the future.
        </p>

          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with

        </h3>

        <p>
          Previously when working on a group project in my Graphic Design
          degree, I was asked to work in a group with a member of the class that
          was fully remote. We were asked to design the branding for a niche
          hobby app and present why we did what we did to the class. I had some
          ideas about how I thought I wanted it to look and pitched them to my
          team member, however they said they’d already done all of the design
          and the presentation and all I needed to do was read the script
          written for why “we’d” done it that way.
          <br />
          <br />
          I didn’t say anything andread the script as they asked. At the time it
          wasn’t important enough to me to disrupt the process, and just let
          them get on with it the way they wanted. I get a little disappointed
          looking back on it now, because I didn’t see any of me in the project
          (obviously) and I missed out on an opportunity to create something I
          was proud of and wanted to showcase on my portfolio.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Some strategies I would try now, would be to maybe press a little
          harder on why they didn’t want to do the project as a group project,
          was it a matter of time saving? Did they have other things they wanted
          to get done so they’d just pressed on and got this done to clear their
          evening for something? maybe try and have more of a dialogue. Maybe
          ask if it was something about my previous design work that put them
          off wanting my design input on the project? Just try to get a better
          understanding as to why they wanted to finish the project by
          themselves. However if they were still insistent on not involving me
          in the project, I would maybe ask the teacher if I could have a try at
          doing it myself, or joining another team that would be willing to have
          input from others.
