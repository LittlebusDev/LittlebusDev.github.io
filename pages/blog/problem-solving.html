          <h3>When I was blocked on a simple problem</h3>
          <p>
            How to get the first letter of a word to be a capital letter. Should
            have been the easiest thing to do. Nuh uh buddy. Not a thing. So I
            think this might have been the hardest part for me, and the most I
            struggled with one of these tasks. I felt like I was right at the
            edge of my knowledge the whole time, so I wasn't even sure what I
            was missing! I could tell that the individual parts of my code were
            working, but I couldn't understand why they wouldn't work together!
          </p>
          <p>
            For this I think I tried ALL of the techniques for problem solving!
            I tried Google, I tried rubber ducky, I tried console.logging, I
            lived in that debugging terminal I reluctantly asked peers for help
            AND I reached out to a coach! Big day for Tori..
          </p>
          <p>
            During the process I felt quite defeated. I definitely cried, and I
            felt like I was pretty stupid for not knowing these answers.. Which
            I know is not helpful, and a break or some time away from the screen
            would have significantly helped the way I was feeling about the
            situation... But I didn't, because I thought I was falling behind.
            Which is my fault.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this those, I realised that I really wasn't too far off, like
            with a lot of the problems I was having during these katas, I was
            like 80% of the way there and my thought processes were right. So
            this was a HUGE win for me.. the fact that I asked a coach for help
            was a huge step forward in my learning process and the fact that I
            could do it was such an incredible feeling when I could get it done.
          </p>
          <h3>When I elegantly solved a problem</h3>
          <p>
            I don't know if it was elegant, but the deBee section of the katas I
            would say was my most succinct problem solving to date! During this
            kata we were asked to remove all iterations of the word 'Buzz' from
            a collection of sentence. On my first attempt, I was able to get rid
            of all of the instances of the word, where it matched EXACTLY, so it
            had the same lack of capitals (I think I'm going to have PTSD
            thinking about capital letters for a while)
          </p>
          <p>
            Either way, I managed to get 2/3rds of the way there without needing
            much need for problem solving (apart from looking up the .filter
            method) which was great! However, I couldn't get the last part,
            which was the removing the word with a capital letter anywhere in
            the word. After a little googling, I found out that I could use the
            .toLowerCase method that had been the bane of my existance in the
            kata before, which felt like a wonderful learning/teaching moment.
            So my first problem solving method was
            <em>Just giving it a go</em> based on what I'd learned from the last
            kata. <br />
            It didn't work straight away, so I <em>rubber ducky-ed</em> out
            loud, trying to say what each part of the code should be doing, and
            managed to spot the mistake and re-organised it. I ran it and it
            worked. I felt like a wizard. I think I laughed out loud to myself
            alone in my living room, it felt amazing.
          </p>
          <h3>How confident am I using these methods of problem solving?</h3>
          <p>
            <em>Pseudocode</em> I do like this, however I feel like I get a
            better understanding of what's supposed to happen by writing it down
            with a pad and pen that I always have with me
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Trying Something</em> This has become my default way of working.
            I'll just try what I think is the right thing, and then if that
            doesn't work, try something else!
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Rubber Ducky Method</em> I actually start by trying to explain
            to myself out loud what it is I think I'm trying to do, to try and
            get that to help me sort out the words and things I'm looking for in
            my head! If that doesn't work, I try the same thinh on my dog!
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Reading Error Messages</em> I love using the Chrome Dev Tools to
            try and concole.log every singular part of my code to make sure what
            I'm coding is doing what I think it should be doing. I feel like I
            use this method almost as much as I Google things!
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Googling</em> This is my absolute go to problem solving method.
            This is my warm snuggly jumper of a go to method! But finding the
            way to phrase what I'm looking for also helps with the rubber ducky
            method, so I need to think about how I want to phrase the question I
            want to type into Google - so it works in tandem!
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Asking My Peers For Help</em> I'm trying to work on this as I
            know this is something I stuggle with and I feel like I'm pointing
            with a big red sign saying I'm more stupid than everyone else, or
            I'm way behind everyone else because I still don't get this.. Which
            is not true, but I feel that resistance every time I go to think
            about asking for help.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Asking Coaches For Help</em> This is also something I'm working
            on. It was only because I was really struggling and that Naomi had
            already reached out to say she was there if I needed her that I even
            considered asking a coach for help. I think this is to my own
            detriment as this is what the coaches are there for, and I'm
            shutting off a great resource if I don't get over myself and learn
            to ask for help! I'm trying...
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Improving My Process With Reflection</em> This is something I
            have not put into my practise at all. I'm trying to move forward
            with the intension that this will be something that I will do,
            however I haven't yet.
          </p>
          <h3>When have I been reluctant to ask for help?</h3>
          <p>
            All the time. Every time. Always. As I've mentioned before in this
            blog I always get reluctant because I don't want to highlight how
            far behind I am, or how much slower I am than others, so I don't
            ask. I am trying to ask more, and have already started to ask.
