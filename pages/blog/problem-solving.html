          <h3>When I was blocked on a simple problem</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h3>When I elegantly solved a problem</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h3>How confident am I using these methods of problem solving?</h3>
          <p>
            <span>Pseudocode</span> I do like this, however I feel like I get a
            better understanding of what's supposed to happen by writing it down
            with a pad and pen that I always have with me
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Trying Something</span> This has become my default way of
            working. I'll just try what I think is the right thing, and then if
            that doesn't work, try something else!
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Rubber Ducky Methos</span> I actually start by trying to
            explain to myself out loud what it is I think I'm trying to do, to
            try and get that to help me sort out the words and things I'm
            looking for in my head! If that doesn't work, I try the same thinh
            on my dog!
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Reading Error Messages</span> I love using the Chrome Dev
            Tools to try and concole.log every singular part of my code to make
            sure what I'm coding is doing what I think it should be doing. I
            feel like I use this method almost as much as I Google things!
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Googling</span> This is my absolute go to problem solving
            method. This is my warm snuggly jumper of a go to method! But
            finding the way to phrase what I'm looking for also helps with the
            rubber ducky method, so I need to think about how I want to phrase
            the question I want to type into Google - so it works in tandem!
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Asking My Peers For Help</span> I'm trying to work on this as
            I know this is something I stuggle with and I feel like I'm pointing
            with a big red sign saying I'm more stupid than everyone else, or
            I'm way behind everyone else because I still don't get this.. Which
            is not true, but I feel that resistance every time I go to think
            about asking for help.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Asking Coaches For Help</span> This is also something I'm
            working on. It was only because I was really struggling and that
            Naomi had already reached out to say she was there if I needed her
            that I even considered asking a coach for help. I think this is to
            my own detriment as this is what the coaches are there for, and I'm
            shutting off a great resource if I don't get over myself and learn
            to ask for help! I'm trying...
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Improving My Process With Reflection</span> This is something
            I have not put into my practise at all. I'm trying to move forward
            with the intension that this will be something that I will do,
            however I haven't yet.
          </p>
          <h3>When have I been reluctant to ask for help?</h3>
          <p>
            All the time. Every time. Always. As I've mentioned before in this
            blog I always get reluctant because I don't want to highlight how
            far behind I am, or how much slower I am than others, so I don't
            ask. I am trying to ask more, and have already started to ask.
